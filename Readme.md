# Keyless Wallet Recovery Solution

## Introduction

The **Keyless Wallet Recovery Solution** is a decentralized protocol designed to allow users to securely recover their wallets through a set of trusted guardians. In traditional key management systems, losing access to your private keys could mean losing access to your assets forever. This solution provides a mechanism for users to set up a group of "guardians" (trusted parties), who can confirm the wallet recovery process in case the wallet owner loses access.

This contract allows users to:
1. **Set up wallet recovery** by defining a list of guardians who can approve a recovery process.
2. **Recover a wallet** when the wallet owner loses access, through confirmations from a majority of the guardians.

The contract ensures that wallet recovery is carried out in a secure, transparent, and decentralized manner by requiring a predefined number of guardians to approve the recovery before any changes are made.

## Vision

The **Keyless Wallet Recovery Solution** aims to provide users with a robust and decentralized method of recovering their wallets without relying on a single point of failure (such as a centralized authority or backup). By using guardians who are trusted parties, the solution ensures that wallet recovery is safe, transparent, and resistant to malicious attacks.

Key features of the project:
- **Decentralized Recovery**: Recovery relies on multiple guardians to prevent unauthorized access or recovery.
- **Security**: The system requires multiple confirmations from guardians to initiate recovery, providing an added layer of security.
- **Simplicity**: The contract is designed to be easy to use and integrate into wallet applications, providing users with an intuitive and secure recovery mechanism.

## Future Goals

1. **Guardian Voting Mechanism**: In the future, we plan to extend the solution by allowing guardians to vote on different types of recovery actions, such as transferring assets or changing recovery conditions. This will introduce a more flexible governance system.
   
2. **Time-based Expiration**: To improve security, we plan to introduce a time-based expiration for the recovery process, ensuring that the recovery process cannot be indefinitely delayed by guardians.
   
3. **Support for Custom Recovery Logic**: Allow wallet owners to configure custom recovery logic based on specific needs, such as specifying different sets of guardians for different types of recovery (e.g., emergency, permanent loss, etc.).

4. **Multi-signature Wallet Support**: Extend the solution to work with multi-signature wallets, ensuring that each recovery attempt requires a majority signature from authorized users.

5. **Audit and Transparency**: Implement a feature to audit all recovery attempts and provide transparency in the process to increase trust in the system.

## Deployed Address of the Project

As of now, the contract has been deployed on the **Aptos Devnet**. The contract address is:

```
0x834064f1d50ec15f175940a04231a8b3cbaf746ff39df55595b715ff3acec81d
```

## How to Use

To use the **Keyless Wallet Recovery Solution**:

1. **Setup Recovery**: A wallet owner can set up recovery by calling the `setup_recovery` function with a list of guardian addresses and the required number of confirmations.
   
2. **Initiate Recovery**: If the wallet owner loses access, any of the guardians can initiate a recovery by calling the `recover_wallet` function. Once enough guardians confirm, the recovery process will be marked as "in progress," and the wallet ownership can be transferred.

For detailed instructions on interacting with the contract, please refer to the **Aptos documentation** and the **Aptos CLI** tool.
